welcome to the first ColdFusion video 
 2016 let's start the year with a bang 
 the form of rocket blasts throughout 
 ages human civilizations have always 
 looked up at the Stars and wondered 
 out there 
 the centuries we've learned a great 
 about space but have had very 
 advancement in the ways of 
 it as time progressed the 
 and capabilities of technology 
 increased but space travel was largely 
 behind by the end of the 20th 
 and into the 21st century space 
 was still complicated expensive 
 worst of all run totally by 
 there's just too much red 
 waiting to snag the fresh ideas of 
 scientists and physicists leading to a 
 style industry until now that is one 
 who chooses to dream big has started 
 change all of this that one man is 
 Musk and his big dream is SpaceX 
 this video we'll learn all about 
 how and why have started its 
 and future plans let's get 
 into it so first up why and how 
 did it get started SpaceX or space 
 exploration technology corporation was 
 in 2002 by Elon Musk the CEO of 
 Motors and the co-founder of 
 is main goal is to create 
 to reduce space 
 costs and enable the 
 of Mars Y space why are you 
 do you think it's important for us 
 be sure at home access to low Earth 
 with with SpaceX it's trying to 
 solve the kind of spacefaring 
 I mean I think that a future 
 we're a spacefaring civilization 
 a multi-planet species is very 
 inspiring awesome future and in 
 for that to happen we've got to 
 improve the cost of 
 we can keep improving the cost of 
 then eventually that trend 
 in the right direction it could be 
 to a city on Mars and certainly 
 the way a lot of activity and low 
 orbit and the moon and lots of 
 exciting things eelain's initial 
 was to create relatively 
 reusable rockets that could 
 travel characteristics similar to 
 commercial airlines that is you 
 send a ship out to space with cargo 
 or any payload re-enter and 
 back on earth and be ready for the 
 next flight within hours in the early 
 Elon approached members of 
 space program three times to 
 access to a refurb Russian rocket 
 order to start his practical space 
 for Elon the deal ended up 
 through but after this he 
 realized something 
 didn't need the Russians or anyone 
 because rocket technology had more 
 less stayed the same since the 1960s 
 for any real progress to be made 
 needed to be a whole new way of 
 things 
 better way not many people believed in 
 space travel so Ellen was going 
 have to do most of this by himself 
 all from his pocket so I had to come 
 with low-cost ways to produce engines 
 primary structured electronics to 
 launch operation as well as run the 
 with with with very little 
 in the end he managed to reduce 
 cost of building rocket greatly by 
 the process into an 
 viable territory think of 
 much like how Henry Ford made the 
 cheap to manufacture 
 80% of all parts from any SpaceX 
 rocket are made in-house by SpaceX 
 themselves okay so that's all nice but 
 what's the big deal 
 firstly eelain's methods are 
 cheaper let me explain 
 for NASA to launch 
 into space just once 
 cost anywhere from 100 to 260 
 dollars for the SpaceX program a 
 9 rocket would cost about 57 
 dollars to make but it is 
 and burns about 200 thousand 
 worth of fuel per launch so 
 much after paying for the rocket 
 is half the price of just a 
 launch anyway you will be 
 a few hundred thousand instead 
 about 200 million per launch this is 
 quantum leap in cost savings this is 
 of the reasons why there's so much 
 excitement around SpaceX all right so 
 cheaper but what else has SpaceX 
 other breakthroughs are there well 
 take a look in 2008 SpaceX became 
 first privately funded liquid 
 rocket to reach orbit in 2010 
 were the first privately funded 
 to successfully launch orbit and 
 a spacecraft 2012 the first 
 company to send a spacecraft to 
 International Space Station 2013 
 delivered a satellite marking the 
 first delivery beyond Earth 
 SpaceX has flown six missions to 
 International Space Station and 
 on December 21st 2015 
 successfully returned a first 
 booster back to the ground 
 very first such accomplishment by an 
 capable rocket the main purpose of 
 mission was to put 11 satellites in 
 orbit for SpaceX s customer or comm 
 Ling soo Miah fun 
 the 
 he want the his life 
 procedural of about walk 
 completion of this mission marks the 
 major advancement in space 
 technology in over 30 years 
 true milestone event proving the 
 endless possibilities of 
 this achievement wasn't 
 failure though the previous 
 attempt failed due to a faulty 
 strut but with all of that being 
 I think the biggest deal and the 
 amazing thing about SpaceX 
 actually how Elon Musk approached the 
 challenges that came his way 
 Elon started SpaceX he came from a 
 engineering and business role 
 PayPal and obviously vastly different 
 to rocket science how is he ever 
 to learn about rocket science to 
 a company based around it the 
 read books and learn rocket 
 according to Elon Musk's 
 biography that's exactly what he did 
 a quote musk felt comfortable 
 up for his positions and 
 teams of coders at PayPal but 
 SpaceX he had to pick things up on 
 job musk initially relied on 
 to form the bulk of his 
 knowledge but as SpaceX hired 
 brilliant person after another musk 
 that he could tap into their 
 of knowledge he would trap an 
 in the SpaceX Factory and set 
 work grilling them about a type of 
 or specialized material one SpaceX 
 Kevin Brogan states I thought 
 first that he was challenging me to 
 if I knew my stuff then I realized 
 was trying to learn things he would 
 you until he had learned 90% of 
 what you know and quote 
 so almost at the end of the video 
 before we finish water Ilan's goals 
 my supposed to reduce the cost of 
 payloads by a factor of 10 to 
 $1,000 per kilogram or less in 
 of 2015 
 asked the federal government to 
 testing for a project that aims to 
 a constellation of 4,000 
 capable of beaming the 
 down to the entire globe 
 including remote regions 
 currently do not have internet 
 access Ellen must long-term vision for 
 the company is to develop technology and 
 suitable for the human 
 of Mars 
 hopes to send humans to Mars by 2030 
 he has expressed interest in living 
 there someday so far this seems like the 
 of science fiction but how close 
 are we actually to getting people in 
 well it actually might be pretty 
 soon spacex has used its dragon 
 to make uncrewed cargo runs 
 the international space station and 
 has proved its basic vessel space 
 the company is scheduled to 
 manned runs to the International 
 Space Station in 2017 so there you have 
 that's the story of SpaceX and what 
 are up to now it's incredible that 
 man and his idea could cut into and 
 disrupt possibly the hardest industry on 
 planet just as a final thought I 
 want to leave you with this here's a 
 quote from Jim Cantrell who was part of 
 founding team at SpaceX with Elon 
 quote so I am going to suggest that 
 Elon is not successful because his 
 vision too grand not because he is 
 smart not because he 
 incredibly hard all those things 
 true but the one major important 
 that sets him apart is his 
 to consider failure it is 
 not in his thought process it 
 matter if he's going up against 
 banking system with PayPal are going 
 against the entire aerospace industry 
 SpaceX while going up against the 
 auto industry with Tesla he cannot 
 not succeeding and this is a 
 critical trait that ultimately 
 him to success what separated us I 
 was his lack of being able to 
 failure I know this because 
 this is how he parted ways of SpaceX we 
 to the point where I could not see 
 succeeding and walked away but he 
 stayed with the project and succeeded I 
 25 years of building space hardware 
 he had none at the time so much for 
 experience and 
 that's just something to think about 
 on that note that's the end of this 
 video I'd like to know your thoughts on 
 SpaceX and what they're doing at the 
 if you're new here feel free to 
 if you want to watch more cool 
 stuff hang around for the next 10 
 seconds and follow the prompts on your 
 screen anyway this has been to gogo and 
 been watching cold fusion thanks 
 for watching I'll catch you again soon 
 the next video 
 guys cold fusion it's me thinking
